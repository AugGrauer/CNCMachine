Here we have outlined a rough build guide. Refer to 3D model as needed


# OVERVIEW
### Step 1. Base & Y Axis mounts
### Step 2. Z Axis
### Step 3. X gantry



## STEP 1.  BASE

### Parts Made:
To build the base of this machine we first cut the peanut bar into the following:

	2x 609.6mm (2ft) bars
	3x 600mm bars
	2x 252.25 mm bars
We also printed:

	3x Normal leg
	1x Limit switch leg
	1x 4 way coupler
	4x Corner coupler
	4x Side coupler
	2x Y Axis Motor Mount
	2x Y Axis Leadscrew endstop
	2x C clamp assist (Optional)
	2x Slide hole center (Optional)
### Assembly
  	1 Mount the linear slides to the 2 foot bars. We made sure that the slides would be mounted so that the slides would be mounted perpendicular to the peanut bar holes. We used our 2 C clamp assist prints to center the slide on the bar, then made sure the rail was centered from end to end on the bar (Same distance from the end of the bar to the start of the slides on each side). We used a hole punch and our Slide hole center prints to make sure we were making the holes in the center of our slides. We then removed the slides, then drilled and tapped all the holes for M5 screws. 
  
  	2 Install the slides. Screw in with M5x16 screws. Do this for both sides of the base.
  
  	3 At this point, we assembled the whole base. It all goes together, it's just a little tricky. Take one side, and put the corner couplers flush in each corner. Attach a side coupler to the center of the bar, and prepare to attach all of these in (Drill and tap holes, don’t screw in yet.). Attach 252.25mm bars to opposing sides of the 4 way couplers so that you can slide it to the middle of the centermost bar (600mm), which should be attached to the side coupler. 
  
  	4 Put side couplers on the exposed ends of the 252.25mm bars. Slide the remaining 2 600mm bars into the corner couplers on the already assembled side. Assemble the second set of corner couplers and singular side coupler onto the other bar with slides, and push it all together. The center bar should go across the machine (see model), and be as centered as possible. 
  
  	5 Mount the Y axis motor mounts flush with the corners. Install Y axis Stepper motors. Install the Y Axis Leadscrew mounts to be in line with the center hole of the Y axis motor mounts.
  
  	6 At this point, you should install the aluminium composite buildplate. Cut this to size, and ensure it fits your machine. Use the holes/ screw locations for the couplers to attach everything securely (aluminium compost and also couplers at the same time.. (Drill, and tap, using M4 screws to attach).
  
  	7 The base is nearly done. Now, slide the carriages onto the Y slides. Ensure that you have removed a screw from the side of each carriage so they go flush. There should be 2 carriages on each slide.
  
  	8 Finally, install the legs. Screw these into the end of each peanut bar, ensuring the leg with a limit switch cutout is in such a position where it will work. For us, it was in the back left of our machine. 

## STEP 2: Z AXIS 

The Z Axis is a pretty important part. We chose to hand cut a lot of components for this out of aluminium, to ensure its rigidity and reliability. We also have 3d models for this to act as stencils or maybe work instead. 


### Parts Made:

	1x back router clamp
	
 	1x front router camp 
	
 	1x Z Limit switch holder
	
 	1x Z stepper holder

	8x Z screw spacer
 
	1x Z Front plate (Aluminium, Stencil?)
 
	1x Z Back plate (Aluminium, Stencil?)
 
	1x x nut holder (Aluminium, Stencil?)

  	3x Z spacers (standoffs)
### Assembly

	1 Screw in the linear rails along the side. Ensure that there are 2 carriages on each rail.This installation used M3-M3.5 Screws (See multipack). These should line up with the holes in the Z front plate.
	
 	2 Next, we screwed in the leadscrew, which should fit in the predefined holes.
	
 	3 Mount the back router clamp onto the carriages. 
	
 	4 Mount the Z limit holder onto the bottom of the Z Front plate. 
	
 	5 Attach the carriages to the back of the Z front plate using M5X16 screws and the Z axis screw spacers. 
	
 	6 Attach Leadscrew nut/traveller to the x nut holder. 
	
 	7 Connect the Z front plate and the Z back plate by attaching the Z axis stepper holder and the x nut holder. We used 2 5mm plates of aluminum to create the x nut holder. Using the stencil, we screwed them together tightly with M3.5 screws and drilled holes in the side to attach, then mounted it to the machine immediately. This is weird so ask us any questions. Also connect this all with the Z spacers (standoffs) in bottom 3 holes.
	
 	8 Mount stepper motor.


## STEP 3: ½ OF X GANTRY

To attach this all, we need to install half the X gantry first. 
### Parts Made:
	1x Right x wall bottom

	1x Left x wall bottom

	1x Left x wall top
	
	1x Right x wall top

	1x xAxisMotorMount

	2x Y leadscrew nut holder

	4x 2ft peanut bars
 
	1x Left inner wall leadscrew endstop
 
	1x Left outer wall leadscrew endstop

We also used our ½ in bar and cut 

	1x 160mm stiffener
 
	2x 100mm stiffener
 
  These are optional for structure

### Assembly 
  	1 Connect the top and bottom of the right side using the dovetail. Screw in the xAxisMotorMount. Use the optional stiffener on this step to lock the dovetail in place on the side. You could also glue or epoxy this to keep it together. 
  
  	2 Construct 2 more linear rail+ peanut bar sets. See base assembly for how we did this. 
  
  	3 Put Y leadscrew nut holders across the bottom 2 peanut bars, x mm away from the edge of the bars. Screw these in with 50mm screws through the bars, ensuring that they are not on the same side as the peanut bar holes.
 
  	4 Push in bottom peanut bars, in addition to the top ones with the rails. Screw these in on the sides. Make sure peanut bar holes line up. 
 
  	5 Construct the other side of X gantry. Use the bottom side with the limit switch holder, and another Top X gantry side. Attach together with the same previous method.
  
  	6 Put the Z axis assembly onto the rails of the X gantry. 
  
  	7 Line both sides up with their respective Y Carriages, which are already mounted on the base. Push together, ensuring that the X gantry stride with peanut bars attached fits nicely into the other side. Line holes up with Y carriages again, and mount using M5x16 screws. Screw peanut bars on the opposite side
  
  	8 Attach X stepper to X leadscrew using clamp, then push through hole on X gantry side. Make sure it goes through the traveller, then into the Left leadscrew endstop (Use the two parts of this to clamp the inside and outside), which is attached opposite the stepper motor. (The stepper motor should be on the stepper holder). Secure stepper motor. 
  
  	9 Push Y lead screws through the bottom nut holder located on the bottom of the X gantry. Secure to stepper motor. 
   	
    	10 Add the wire holders spaced along the bottom of the X gantry. You'll want to already have the wire in here if you plan to do it this way. Next, attach the cable chain to the top X bar.



# NOTES:
Follow the CAD model and videos as you go. Between this and those resources, it should hopefully be clear what to do.
